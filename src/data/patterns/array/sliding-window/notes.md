# Sliding Window Notes

## Fixed Window
- Window size remains constant
- Use for problems like "maximum sum of subarray of size K"

## Variable Window
- Window size changes based on condition
- Use for problems like "longest substring without repeating characters"

## Key Points
- Two pointers: left and right
- Expand right pointer to include elements
- Shrink left pointer when condition violated
- Update answer in each iteration
