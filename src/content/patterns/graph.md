# Graph Patterns

## Overview
- Definition: A Graph G = (V, E) is a structure of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges).
- Core Principle: Graphs model relationships and connections.

## Types
- By Direction: Undirected, Directed
- By Weight: Unweighted, Weighted
- By Connectivity: Connected, Disconnected, Strongly Connected
- Special: Tree, DAG, Bipartite, Complete, Cyclic

## Traversal
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)

## Practice Problems
- Number of Provinces
- Number of Islands
- Course Schedule
- Redundant Connection
- Network Delay Time
