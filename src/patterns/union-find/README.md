# Union-Find (Disjoint Set) Pattern

## What is it?
Data structure to track elements in disjoint sets with near-constant time operations.

## What problems does it solve?
- Connected components
- Cycle detection in undirected graphs
- Dynamic connectivity
- Minimum spanning tree

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(α(n)) ≈ O(1) with optimizations
- **Space**: O(n)
