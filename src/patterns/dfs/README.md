# Depth-First Search (DFS) Pattern

## What is it?
Go deep along each branch before backtracking, using recursion or stack.

## What problems does it solve?
- Tree traversals (pre/in/post-order)
- Path finding
- Backtracking (permutations, subsets)
- Graph exploration

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for recursion stack
