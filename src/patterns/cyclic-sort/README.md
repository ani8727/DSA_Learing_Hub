# Cyclic Sort Pattern

## What is it?
Place each number at its correct index for arrays with numbers in a given range.

## What problems does it solve?
- Finding missing numbers
- Finding duplicate numbers
- First missing positive

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) - each number swapped at most once
- **Space**: O(1) - in-place sorting
