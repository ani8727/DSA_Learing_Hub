# Two Pointers Pattern

## What is it?
The Two Pointers pattern uses two reference points to iterate through data structures, often from opposite ends or at different speeds.

## What problems does it solve?
- Finding pairs in sorted arrays
- Removing duplicates in-place
- Validating palindromes
- Container with most water
- Three sum problems

## Learning Outcomes
1. Recognize when two pointers can optimize brute force solutions
2. Implement converging, same-direction, and expanding pointer techniques
3. Handle edge cases in pointer-based solutions

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
