# Graph Algorithms Pattern

## What is it?
Collection of algorithms for traversing, searching, and optimizing graphs.

## Key Algorithms
- **Dijkstra**: Shortest path (non-negative weights)
- **Bellman-Ford**: Shortest path (handles negative weights)
- **Topological Sort**: Order DAG vertices
- **Floyd-Warshall**: All-pairs shortest paths

## Common Problems
- Shortest path
- Cycle detection
- Topological ordering
- Minimum spanning tree
