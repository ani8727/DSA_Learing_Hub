# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Pattern

## What is it?
Level-by-level traversal using a queue data structure.

## What problems does it solve?
- Shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Level-order tree traversal
- Multi-source spreading problems

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for the queue
