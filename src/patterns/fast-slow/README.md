# Fast & Slow Pointers Pattern (Tortoise and Hare)

## What is it?
Uses two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles or find middle elements.

## What problems does it solve?
- Cycle detection in linked lists
- Finding middle of linked list
- Happy number problem
- Palindrome linked list

## Learning Outcomes
1. Detect cycles in O(n) time and O(1) space
2. Find cycle start point
3. Find middle element in one pass

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
