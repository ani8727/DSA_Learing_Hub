# DSA Pattern Hub

A practical learning platform for Data Structures and Algorithms, organized by problem-solving patterns.

🌐 **Live Site:** [https://ani8727.github.io/DSA_Learing_Hub/](https://ani8727.github.io/DSA_Learing_Hub/)

## About

This project helps developers prepare for coding interviews by teaching common DSA patterns. Instead of memorizing individual problems, you'll learn to recognize patterns that appear across multiple problems.

## Features

- **19 Core Patterns** covering 327+ LeetCode problems
- **Pattern-based organization** (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS, BFS, etc.)
- **Interactive UI** with dark/light theme toggle
- **Problem sets** with hints and solutions
- **Theory explanations** for each pattern
- **Code examples** in JavaScript and C++
- **Responsive design** - works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Search functionality** to find patterns quickly

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Latest React with modern hooks
- **Vite 6.0** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS 3** - Utility-first styling
- **React Router 7** - Client-side routing
- **React Icons** - Icon library
- Deployed on **GitHub Pages**

## Patterns Covered

### Array Patterns
- **Two Pointers** - Efficient array/string traversal
- **Sliding Window** - Contiguous subarray problems
- **Fast & Slow Pointers** - Cycle detection, middle element
- **Merge Intervals** - Overlapping intervals
- **Cyclic Sort** - Missing/duplicate numbers

### Graph Patterns  
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search) - Graph traversal, backtracking
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) - Shortest path, level-order
- **Union-Find** - Connected components, cycle detection

### Tree Patterns
- **Tree DFS** - Preorder, inorder, postorder traversals
- **Tree BFS** - Level-order traversal

## Screenshots

### Dark Mode (Default)
Professional dark theme optimized for coding and learning.

### Light Mode
Clean light theme with toggle button in navbar.

## Key Features Explained

### 🎯 Pattern-First Learning
Instead of solving random problems, learn patterns that apply to multiple problems. Master 19 patterns to solve 327+ problems.

### 🔍 Smart Search
Quickly find patterns by name, category, or difficulty level.

### 📱 Responsive Design
Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 🌓 Theme Toggle
Switch between dark and light modes based on your preference. Theme preference is saved in browser.

### 💻 Code Examples
Every pattern includes code implementations in:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- C++ (Modern C++)
