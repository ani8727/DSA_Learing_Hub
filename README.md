# DSA Pattern Hub

A practical learning platform for Data Structures and Algorithms, organized by problem-solving patterns.

## About

This project helps developers prepare for coding interviews by teaching common DSA patterns. Instead of memorizing individual problems, you'll learn to recognize patterns that appear across multiple problems.

## Features

- **19 Core Patterns** covering 327+ LeetCode problems
- Pattern-based organization (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS, BFS, etc.)
- Problem sets with hints and solutions
- Theory explanations for each pattern
- Code examples in JavaScript and C++

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Patterns Covered

### Array Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort

### Graph Patterns  
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Union-Find

### Tree Patterns
- Tree DFS
- Tree BFS
